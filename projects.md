: compiler and emulator of a G-machine loosely based on [*Implementing functional languages: a tutorial*](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/implementing-functional-languages-a-tutorial) by simon peyton jones and david lester. this is a teaching aid for a practical bachelor course loosely based on the mentioned book. my friend zhu yang and i built it using GHCJS in [this repository](https://github.com/yang-zhu/fin/tree/script_version_web). we created [a test suite for student submissions](https://gitlab.com/rdnz/g-machine/-/blob/main/test/Spec.hs) too. [this repository](https://gitlab.com/rdnz/g-machine/-/tree/web) contains [an uglier version](https://g-machine.de.cool/) of the same teaching aid too, which i had built on my own before.

[parser combinator library](https://gitlab.com/rdnz/parser-combinators-rednaz)
